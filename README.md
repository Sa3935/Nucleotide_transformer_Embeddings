# Nucleotide_transformer_Embeddings
The Nucleotide Transformer project employs state-of-the-art machine learning methodologies to generate embeddings for the classification of gene taxonomic groups. By leveraging the Nucleotide Transformer 500M multi-species model, we extracted high-dimensional vector representations from nucleotide sequences, taxonomy groups.
